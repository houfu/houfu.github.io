## Strategic Legal Technology for Real-World Constraints

I'm a corporate counsel who helps solo counsels and small legal teams leverage technology strategically. After learning to code out of necessity, I built automation tools that streamlined contract processes and contributed to my promotion—all while working within typical corporate constraints.

Now I teach other lawyers to build practical solutions using budget-friendly tools and realistic timelines.

## My Approach: $50 Solutions That Replace $50K Systems

The legal technology market is full of expensive, over-engineered solutions that don't address the real problems facing resource-constrained legal departments. My focus is on practical automation that actually works in corporate environments.

**What I specialize in:**
- Document automation and contract processing workflows
- No-code AI agents for policy guidance and compliance queries  
- Legal process optimization using existing enterprise tools
- Practical programming solutions for common legal tasks

**My technical work includes:**
- Python automation for document processing and analysis
- Microsoft Copilot Studio agents for legal workflows
- Integration projects using APIs and existing enterprise systems
- Open source tools and transparent methodologies

## Who I Help

**Solo counsels and small legal teams** who need to:
- Automate repetitive tasks without massive IT investments
- Build practical AI solutions within existing Microsoft 365 environments
- Streamline contract and compliance processes
- Leverage technology strategically without becoming full-time developers

**The reality I understand:** You have limited budgets, minimal IT support, and need solutions that work immediately without extensive training or infrastructure changes.

## My Background

As a corporate counsel with experience in legal operations, compliance, and data protection, I understand both the legal requirements and practical constraints that shape technology decisions in legal departments.

My programming journey started with necessity—I needed to solve workflow problems that existing tools couldn't address. This practical foundation means I focus on solutions that deliver measurable value rather than impressive technical complexity.

## Let's Connect

I'm committed to open source development and transparent sharing of practical legal technology solutions. Most of my work is released under open source licenses to help the broader legal community.

If you're working on similar challenges or want to discuss practical legal automation, I'd welcome the conversation.
