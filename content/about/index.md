## Hi, I'm Houfu. 

I stumbled into Law mainly by accident when I was an 18-year-old kid wondering what to do with my life.  I also stumbled into computers and programming mainly as a kid needing something to do with my life. I trip over things a lot.

Now as an adult, I've realised that the only things worth doing, are the things I want to do with my life. 

## Corporate Counsel by Day

In my day job, I am valued partner to bussssiineesss ... with a wide range of experiences, with special emphasis on legal ops, compliance, data protection and the like. I got certificates and memberships because I enjoy learning new stuff. 

You can check out my CV or [download it](https://res.cloudinary.com/lovelawrobots/image/upload/Ang_Hou_Fu_2_bqcq2n.pdf) if you're into that sort of thing.

## Coder at Night

I'm a self taught programmer. The main languages I use nowadays are Python, Javascript... and if you count that sort of thing: SQL, Docker and many others.

The problem is, I learn what I need to get my interests going. Sadly, this means picking up many things I find useful that will get me to the finish line ASAP.

This does means that I have a good sense what's worth picking up, and what's useless and hype. 

I'm a big firm believer in Open Source, and most of my work is ever only released under open source licenses.
